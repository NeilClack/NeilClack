- 👋 Hi, I’m @NeilClack
- 👀 I’m interested in many things, from web development to machine learning, from microcontrollers to super computers, and from Earth to the deepest, darkest depths of space!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, Redux and Node.js for full-stack web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, right now. I'm busy learing and building.
- 📫 How to reach me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/NeilClack), on Github, or by [Email](NeilClack001@gmail.com)
